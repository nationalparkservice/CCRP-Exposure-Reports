# Introduction

Rising temperatures, changing precipitation regimes, stronger storms, and other climatic changes are evident across America's national parks. Effects include more severe wildland fires and floods, declining snowpack, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, intensifying drought, and increasing erosion. The pervasiveness of climate change impacts on resources, assets, operations, and human wellbeing means that all parks stand to benefit from recognizing and addressing climate change threats. The National Park Service (NPS) has developed guidance and resources to help parks do so in their planning processes (<https://www.nps.gov/subjects/climatechange/planning.htm>).

The NPS [*Planning for a Changing Climate*](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2279647) guide emphasizes that climate-informed plans must:

1)  Develop forward-looking goals that consider future climatic conditions by using climate projections, and

2)  Consider more tan one scenario of the future when developing management strategies and actions.

*Climate change adaptation is an adjustment in natural or human systems that moderates harm or harnesses beneficial opportunities. Timely, forward looking adaptation can help conserve cultural and natural resources, develop climate change-ready infrastructure, safeguard human well being and foster a positive visitor experience. See [Climate Change Glossary](https://irmadev.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/665664) for full definition.*

This *climate change exposure report* describes both recent changes in climate (historical trends) and plausible climate trajectories at LONGNAME (`r params$name`). Characterization of potential climate change includes a small set of divergent climate futures that span a broad range of ways in which climate might plausibly change in the park in coming decades. This approach of recognizing and planning around a range of climate futures is a practical response to the impossibility of precisely predicting greenhouse gas emissions and how climate will respond to them. Climate futures help parks work with this uncertainty and make short- and long-term decisions that avoid surprises and costly mistakes.

# Historical climate change

Temperatures in `r params$name` have already increased significantly (Figure 1.) Average annual temperature increased at Tavg.rate.1900 °F per century (p \< 0.001) from 1900-2022, and since 1970 -- when anthropogenic climate changes become more apparent -- at the extremely rapid rate of Tavg.rate.1970 °F per century (p \< 0.001)[[1]](#_ftn1) (Figure 1; See Runyon et al. [*In prep*] for full methodological details and plain-language FAQ). Annual temperature anomalies in Tavg.Anomalies.1 and Tavg.Anomalies.2 have been exceeded Tavg.Anomalies.recent percent of years since 2000 (Tavg.Anomalies.recent.percent %). Since 1970, daily minimum (night-time) temperatures have increased more rapidly than daily maximum (daytime) temperatures, and therefore nights are warmer and the range between daytime and nighttime temperatures has diminished. Precipitation has Prcp.trend since 1970 but remains highly variable. Years with historically high precipitation totals (e.g., PrcpAbove.Anomalies.1 and PrcpAbove.Anomalies.2) occur less frequently. This trend in `r params$name`-specific data is consistent with regional trends towards more frequent extreme rainfall events (Figure 2).

# Projected climate change

**Annual average temperature and precipitation**

Relative to the 1979-2012 baseline period, all climate models project significant warming by circa 2050 (mean of 2035-2065) with a range of projected increases in average annual temperature from +Future.DeltaTavg.min °F to +Future.DeltaTavg.max °F. Annual precipitation is projected to change by Future.DeltaPr.min (Future.DeltaPr.min.percent %) to Future.DeltaPr.max inches (+Future.DeltaPr.max.percent %) compared to historical (1979-2012) annual averages (See Runyon et al. [in prep] for methodological details). Seasonal shifts in precipitation patterns and growing season length vary among climate models and climate futures. Given this range of projections, planning for a single future is highly unlikely to help prepare for what will transpire. Thus, identifying, developing, and planning around a set of plausible, divergent climate futures is important (Lawrence et al. 2021; Runyon et al. in prep). To support planning for a broad range of plausible climate changes at `r params$name`, selected two climate futures -- "Warm Wet" and "Hot Dry" future circa 2050 -- to capture relevant variation across the climate models and greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The following sections focus on these two climate futures.

Average annual temperatures are projected to continue increasing relative to the 1979-2012 historical period in both climate futures, but the magnitude of that increase differs with considerable warming (+DeltaTavg.CF1 °F) in the Warm Wet climate future and extreme warming (+DeltaTavg.CF2 °F) in the Hot Dry climate future (Figure 3. See Appendix 1 for "Table of changes for climate metrics"). Although these trends may seem modest, temperatures during the hottest two years in the historical record (Tavg.Anomalies.1 and Tavg.Anomalies.2) would be "average years" in the Warm Wet climate future, and a "hot" year at that time would exceed the historical range of variation. By 2050, temperatures every year in the Hot Dry climate future would exceed those experienced at `r params$name` since 1895. These are large changes that will be associated with the large reduction in frost days, many more days with high temperatures, and a much longer growing season (See Appendix 1).

Uncertainty exists regarding the direction in which annual precipitation with change, with the warm wewt climate future projecting + DeltaPrcp.CF1 inches and DeltaPrcp.CF2 in annual precipitation for the hot dry climate future relative to 1979-2012. Regardless of the ultimate trend, the precipitation variability that `r params$name` has always experienced will continue.

Respectively, the blue and red lines represent the warm wet and hot dry climate futures. The smooth, dark line running through each projection is the 10-year running average. Gray-shaded area represents the time period (2025-2055) over which projections were averaged to summarized changes from the baseline (Appendix 1).](`r fig3`){width="400"}

## Extreme Events

Average temperature and precipitation changes, particularly annual measures, can demonstrate direction and relative magnitude of change for each climate future, but on their own can be difficult to translate into resource impacts (Lawrence et al. 2021; Miller et al. 2022). Averages don't adequately capture variability and resulting changes in extremes or compound events that are often highly consequential for resources. Therefore, we summarize metrics of climate extremes below, with the caveat that these analyses necessarily evaluate events that occur rarely and, as such, are less frequently observed and are difficult to characterize. There is therefore a broader range in these projections than for temperature or precipitation averages.

**Extreme temperature**

Extreme temperatures threaten park staff and visitor safety, accelerate weathering of structures, and increase stress on ventilation and air conditioning systems. If not addressed through building design or more efficient temperature control systems, the increased demand for complex air conditioning systems can add stress to building envelopes and require significant alterations to structures. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established guidelines (OSHA 2019) associated with heat index classifications and protective measures that should be taken for ranges of heat index values. In 2004, the NPS Risk Management Office issued guidance that general heat stress controls should be applied when heat index exceeds 105 °F, which is within the "dangerous" heat index range (NPS 2004). Extreme temperatures are expected to increase at `r params$name` under both climate futures (Figure 4) with + HI.Dan.CF1 days/yr exceeding the dangerous heat index threshold for the more modest Warm Wet climate future and + HI.Dan.CF2 days/yr of those incidents under the Hot Dry future.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fig4 <- paste0("data/", params$name, "/WamWet_HotDry/figures/OverHotTemp-HI.Dan-Panel.jpg")
```
![**Figure 4.** Metrics of extreme temperature at `r params$name`. The upper plot represents the number of days per year when maximum temperature exceeds the historical 95th percentile at `r params$name` historically and in both climate futures. The lower plot is the number of days per year when heat index reaches 'dangerous' levels (103-124 °F).](`r fig4`){width="400"}

**Extreme precipitation**

`r params$name` has historically received an average of nClim.Prcp.mean inches of precipitation per year. Depending on the pattern of change, changing precipitation and humidity can result in local flooding, encourage mold growth and wood decay, increase fire risk, and intensify drought conditions. Extreme precipitation events and flooding risks are expected to regionally intensify (Easterling et al.2017, US ACE 2016, Dethier et al. 2020, Tabari 2020). By the end of the 21st century under assumptions of continuing high greenhouse gas emissions, a doubling of the number of heavy rainfall events (2-day precipitation events with a 5-year return period) is possible, as is a 21% increase in rain falling on the heaviest precipitation days (days with a 20-year return period; Allan and Soden 2008, Easterling et al. 2017). These changes, combined with an ongoing shift toward more intense tropical storms (Kossin et al. 2020), would increase flood risk. Other factors interact with climate change to promote flooding including urbanization, reductions in vegetation cover, and other land cover changes that influence runoff (Yang et al. 2015; Peterson et al. 2013). It is important to understand the local patterns and drivers of flooding when planning infrastructure. Floods threaten infrastructure and operations through a variety of mechanisms, including inundation of structures, enhanced erosional forces, road wash out, structural collapse from the force of floodwaters, sewage backup, and damage to utilities, generators, and electrical systems. Post-flooding effects include increased rot, fungal/insect attack, mold and mildew, and physical deterioration of wood, brick, and stone building materials. Damage is often due to indirect effects, such as loss of power, potable water, or access. Extreme precipitation events are likely to increase the risks from flash floods and from geologic hazards. Slope failures caused by intense rainstorms will also be a concern in topographically vulnerable areas.

Extreme precipitation is expected to increase at `r params$name` under both climate futures (Figure 5). Historically (1979-2012) Hist_return50 inches of rainfall in a 24-hour period was a 40-year return precipitation event. In the Warm Wet climate future, Hist_return50 inches in a 24-hour period has a return interval of CF1_return.year years, whereas the magnitude of a 40-year flood event would increase to CF1_return50 inches in a 24-hour period. The Hot Dry climate future projects an event of Hist_return50 inches of rain in a day every CF2_return.year years and a 40-year event increases to CF2_return50 inches (Figure 5, upper plot). Figure 5 (lower plot) shows the number of days per year in which precipitation at `r params$name` is greater than or equal to HistPrecip99 inches (i.e., the historical 95th-percentile event).

```
![**Figure 5.** Upper plot: Modeled recurrence intervals (annual) for 24-hour precipitation events for each climate future and the historical period. The x axis indicates the return period expected for the amount of precipitation received in a day indicated on the y axis (see Methodological note for details). Lower plot: Number of days per year in which rainfall ≥ HistPrecip99 inches, the historical 95th-percentile event.](`r fig5`){width="400"}

**Drought (drought characteristics)**

Rising air temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are increasing drought risk in many parts of the United States (Wehner et al. 2017). Changing drought conditions (frequency, severity, duration) can challenge a variety of infrastructure and operations (Department of Homeland Security 2015) in the NPS (e.g., water supply and wastewater systems), impair water quality (Mosley 2015), affect soil heaves and shrinkages (Fernandes et al. 2015), enhance wildfire risks (Jolly et al. 2015), and entrain a diversity of ecological changes (Crausbay et al. 2017).

The Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) integrates temperature and precipitation to provide a metric to assess changing drought conditions at `r params$name` Figure 6 shows the annual SPEI values (SPEI-6, averaged for each year; see methodological note for details) for each climate future and drought characteristics (duration, return interval, and severity). For the Hot Damp climate future, drought duration and severity increase relative to historical drought while the system will have less time to recover between these events (i.e., shorter drought-free interval; Figure 6). For the Warm Wet climate future, droughts would become shorter, occur less frequently, and be less severe.

The gray shaded area represents the 2025-2055 period upon which the characteristics are averaged (See climate exposure methods note <INSERT LINK> for methodological details). The lower three plots show characteristics of average drought conditions for the historical period (1979-2012) and two climate futures (2025-2055).](`r fig6`){width=400}

**Wildfire**

Wildfire is a natural part of many forest, woodland, and grassland ecosystems. Excessive fire, however, can transform ecosystems, kill people, and damage infrastructure. Climate change is intensifying the heat that drives wildfire (Jolly et al. 2015) and altering the distribution and density of vegetation that comprises the fuel for wildfires (Westerling et al. 2016). These effects combine with the buildup of coarse woody debris and understory trees from decades of suppression of all fires, even natural ones (Agee and Skinner 2005). The effects of climate change on wildfire vary across landscapes. For areas where projected climate change increases fire risk, buildings, cultural landscapes, and other infrastructure are vulnerable to burning and destruction.

**Plant-available water**

Climatic water deficit -- the difference between potential evapotranspiration and actual -- is an indicator of the amount of additional water plants would use if it were available and it is often used to indicate landscape dryness. As such, it is typically positively correlated with increased fire risk and plant stress (Thoma et al. 2020). Climatic water deficit is determined using a water balance model (see methods) that accounts for the interactive effects of temperature and precipitation. The average annual water deficit in `r params$name` is increasing in both climate futures (Warm Wet CF1.WBdelta inches/year [slightly wetter], Hot Dry + C2.WBdelta inches/year [drier]; Figure 8). Both climate futures have many more years that are wetter or drier relative to the past, and fewer years that are 'average'. Under the Hot Dry climate future, water deficit in the average year will be comparable to years that currently would be considered dry. For that future the park can expect most years to have reduced plant growth, lower stream flow, and increased fire risk and plant stress.

The lower plot shows (annual) distributions of climatic water deficit relative to annual actual evapotranspiration historically and for each climate future.](`r fig7`){width="400"}

**Invasive species and pests**

In addition to impacts on natural resources, terrestrial and aquatic invasive species have the potential to cause direct damage to power, water, transportation, and building facilities (Vissichelli 2018). Climate change can favor invasive alien plant species, such as kudzu, in temperate zone ecosystems due to increased warmth, humidity, vegetation disturbances, and atmospheric carbon dioxide (Davidson et al. 2011, Hellmann et al. 2008, Liu et al. 2017). Climate change can also exacerbate aquatic invasive species, favored by warmer waters and other altered conditions in freshwater ecosystems (Havel et al. 2015). Rooting and burrowing mammals and termites have the potential to cause direct damage to power, water, transportation, and building facilities (Vissichelli 2018). Facilities may also be impacted indirectly through other mechanisms exacerbated by climate change, such as forest insect pest invasions or fluctuating ground water levels leading to increased tree stress and mortality, hazard trees, and treefall. `r params$name` is in a region where weeds and non-native aquatic mussels have the potential to cause direct damage to power, water, transportation, and building facilities (Vissichelli 2018). Non-native species that may not currently impact facilities may become harmful due to changes in local climates (NRC 2002, IPCC 2014).

# Planning that addresses climate change implications for resources and assets

Concepts from [*Planning for a Changing Climate*](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2279647) can help address the above-described potential climate impacts into planning at `r params$name` and develop a robust climate change response, which will better protect park resources and assets today and for future generations. Potential climate impacts can be considered during goal setting, testing existing management activities, or identifying new climate change adaptation strategies. Below are some of the key principles from Planning for a Changing Climate, intended to inform a park's climate change response.

**Develop forward-looking goals that consider future climatic conditions**

Adaptation planning looks to the future, which is recognized as likely to differ from the past, using climate projections to adopt forward-looking goals. The term 'goals' should be interpreted broadly, recognizing that different planning processes use different terms and approaches. For example, a General Management Plan or a Visitor Use Management Plan may focus on developing desired conditions, whereas a Resource Stewardship Strategy seeks to identify long- and short-term goals. Regardless of the specific terminology, adaptation planning offers an important opportunity to establish or adjust climate-informed goals, which look to the future and seek to strike a balance between traditional aspirations and emerging realities. Furthermore, the information provided above can be used to identify climate implications for management strategies and actions that may flow from broader climate-informed goals.

**Putting it into action:** This report provides information about past, present, and potential future climate conditions for `r params$name`. The intent of this work is to enable managers to use climate information to develop new goals (e.g., desired conditions) or reconsider existing management goals. If a goal clearly cannot be met under projected future conditions, it needs updating. Goals should acknowledge continuous change and the potential for unavoidable losses or ecological transformations.

The worksheet below (Table 1) is an example that can be used to help assess whether draft desired conditions, and/or management strategies and actions are feasible under different climate scenarios. Use this worksheet in conjunction with the climate information provided above to identify potential climate implications for desired conditions, goals, strategies, and/or actions and revise them as needed.

-   Adaptation planning offers an important opportunity to establish or adjust ***desired conditions*** for the future and formulate ***climate-informed goals*** that strike a balance between traditional aspirations and emerging realities.

-   If it is apparent that goals cannot be met under projected future conditions, goals will need to be updated or refined. Goals should increasingly acknowledge continuous change and the potential for unavoidable losses or transformations.

**Consider more than one scenario of the future**

Adaptation planning considers *multiple* *scenarios* of the future to account for uncertainty in the anticipated scope, magnitude, and effects of climate change. This rigorous, structure approach allows planners to (1) explore a variety of *plausible future conditions*; (2) evaluate the implications of those conditions; and (3) identify a portfolio of possible management strategies. A similar table or exercise to Table 1 can be used for testing or developing management strategies or other plan elements that need to articulate future goals. See Schuurman et al. 2019 for examples. **Putting it into action:** This report provides two climate scenarios ("Warm-Wet" and "Hot-Dry") that represent plausible future conditions for `r params$name`. Under each future, managers can identify what strategies and actions can reduce risk and enable the park to meet its goals. You might also consider what strategies and action can take advantage of possible opportunities under each scenario.

1.  Start by brainstorming an array of strategies that could address important climate risks. Consult existing sources of climate-informed management strategies and actions, which might be found in other planning documents like and RSS, NRCA, CRSA, climate-friendly park plan, or vulnerability assessment, among others.

2.  Next, decide how you will compare and evaluate strategies to decide which to select and include in the plan. Strategies and actions could be evaluated based on their effectiveness across multiple scenarios, effectiveness in the 'worst case' scenario, how they align with park management goals, and/or their feasibility.
